Unit 03:

80% of pages is <div>

block element is match_parent in width by default
<div> has no paddings and margins by default

inline element is wrap_content in width and height
inline elements:
span, img, a, b, i, button
!!! inline elements can have only horizontal margins !!!
!!! inline elements ignore height style !!!

display style changes element mode: block or inline or ...

if we want to leave inline elements wrap-content in width, but we want to change their vertical margins or height, we can use display: inline-block

display: inline-block - makes inline element still wrap_content, but with vertical margin and height styles
